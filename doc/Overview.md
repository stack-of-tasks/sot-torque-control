The library sot-torque-control contains a collection of dynamic-graph entities aimed at implementing torque control on different robots.
You can find a description of the main entities in the following <a href="https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/sot-torque-control/wiki">wiki</a>.

## Dependencies
This project depends on:
* [dynamic-graph](https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/dynamic-graph) >= 3.0.0
* [dynamic-graph-python](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/dynamic-graph-python) >= 3.0.0
* [sot-core](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/sot-core) >= 3.0.0
* [pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) >= 1.2
* [tsid](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/tsid) >= 1.2
* [PinInvDyn](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/invdyn)
* [parametric-curves](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/parametric-curves)
* [simple_humanoid_description](https://github.com/laas/simple_humanoid_description)(for unit testing)

All of these packages (except PinInvDyn) can be installed through [robotpkg](http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/).
In particular, you can find them in [robotpkg-wip](http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/robotpkg-wip.html) (work in progress), a subset of robotpkg.

You will need the sot-talos and talos-dev packages:
```
sudo apt-get install robotpkg-py27-sot-talos robotpkg-talos-dev
```

Pay attention not to install ROS using robotpkg though, because it would install the latest version, which may not be what you need.


You can find the full installation procedure in the <a href="md_doc_installation.html">installation page</a>.
